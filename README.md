# China's Financial Public Diplomacy in East Asia  

Visualizing Chinese financial public diplomacy towards Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos from 2000-2016 using data from AidData at William and Mary.   

Under the Obama administration, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton [vocally](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/11/americas-pacific-century/) spearheaded an effort to pivot the United States towards Asia. [Critics](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/did-hillary-clintons-pivot-to-asia-work/) have questioned whether the pace and magnitude of Clinton's pivot were sufficient to secure US interests in the region. Given that the America's primary competitor for influence in the region is China, and that the degree of economic integration is a powerful indicator of influence, I created this visualization of China's financial public diplomacy towards a sample of four East Asian nations to allow for comparisons with America's parallel investments in the region. 

Many thanks to [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/) for creating the dataset and making the data and documentation freely accessible to the public. I borrow their definitions of financial public diplomacy to categorize financial transactions for this graphic.
